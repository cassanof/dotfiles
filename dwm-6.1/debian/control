Description: dynamic window manager
 dwm is a minimalistic window manager. It manages windows in tiling and floating
 modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically, depending on the application in
 use and the task performed.
 .
 In tiling mode windows are managed in a master and stacking column. The master
 column contains the window which needs most attention at a time, whereas the
 stacking column contains all other windows in a stack. Dialog windows are
 managed floating, however.
 .
 In floating mode windows can be resized and moved freely. Windows are grouped
 by tags. All windows with a specific tag can be viewed at a time. But each
 window may contain more than one tag, which makes it visible in several views.
 .
 Please notice that dwm is currently customized through editing its source code,
 so you probably want to build your own dwm packages. This package is compiled
 with the default configuration and should just give you an idea about what dwm
 brings to your desktop.
